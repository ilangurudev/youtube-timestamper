This library can help create timestamped chapters by picking out the questions in Question-Answer style videos.\nTo start, simply import YoutubeTimestamper from youtube_timestamper.core and pass in a youtube video url.\n\nfrom youtube_timestamper.core import YoutubeTimestamper\n\n/home/ilangurudev/anaconda3/envs/ds/lib/python3.9/site-packages/transformers/pipelines/token_classification.py:135: UserWarning: `grouped_entities` is deprecated and will be removed in version v5.0.0, defaulted to `aggregation_strategy=\"none\"` instead.\n  warnings.warn(\n\n\n\nyt_ts = YoutubeTimestamper(\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGCvycOXs2M\")\n\n\nyt_ts.suggest_question_timestamps(next_q_thresh=20)\n\n/home/ilangurudev/anaconda3/envs/ds/lib/python3.9/site-packages/transformers/pipelines/base.py:1036: UserWarning: You seem to be using the pipelines sequentially on GPU.

As we can see,\n\nThe suggestions contain all questions - that means the interviewee’s questions too (and then someone says, wow, that’s awesome, hey, have you thought about doing this?).\nSometimes the questions don’t provide the complete context - they look like tarantino chapter titles. (i mean, how does a computer know how to draw dogs?)\nThe questions are too long and need to be summarized. (how did you go from just starting your journey to today being the forex grandmaster? how would you advise? what should they read? what should they learn? do you think there’s such a list?)\nThe youtube transcripts also contain a ton of typos (kagan, forex grandmaster)\nSometimes some questions are missed - the model is not perfect.\n\nBut I can just edit these timestamps and clean them up quickly manually as opposed tostarting from scratch. I remove\n\nIrrelevant questions\nSummarize questions neatly (and sometimes go back to the video to get enough context)\nCorrect typos\nLook for large gaps where there are no chapters and manually insert titles if need be.\n\n00:00:00 Introduction 00:02:23 Secret to Kaggle Success 00:02:48 Exclusive Kaggle Fight Club Invites LOL 00:04:21 Life leading up to Kaggle 00:07:19 Beginning of addiction to Kaggle 00:10:15 Journey to 4x Grandmaster and Tips 00:11:49 Motivation to Kaggle - Fun or Improvement 00:13:39 Favorite battle stories 00:16:03 Approach to Competitions 00:25:45 Advice for newbies looking to write kernels 00:30:58 Advice for people who span kaggle forums in search of titles 00:32:51 Favorite memories from discussions 00:35:35 Teaming Strategy and Advice 00:38:47 Reason for investing so much time into Kaggle 00:43:30 Rapids 00:47:11 Secret to time management 00:50:30 Rapid Fire 00:51:12 Favorite Course that you’ve taught 00:52:38 Favorite Algorithm 00:53:55 Favorite Competition so far 01:00:28 Favorite spot to surf 01:01:24 Favorite way to unwind from data science and Kaggle\nCreated using youtube-timestamper - https://ilangurudev.github.io/youtube-timestamper/\nNow simply copy paste as a comment in the video!"
